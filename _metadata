Humanity is either under some new power or near extinct. To any and all remaining Protectors in this dark galaxy, our hearts and minds are with you, for you are our last chance, our last hope, for redemption\"\n\nThis mod is basically a miscellaneous content mod with a strong focus on expanding upon the game's lore in a manner in-keeping with its canon, as well as introducing things I feel are \"\"\"missing\"\"\" (in a particularly subjective sense) from the base game. Given the fairly even spread of the mod's content, it's meant to have a fairly light footprint on the game, although expect it to get larger in stature as time goes on.\n\nSome of the more notable bits of content in the mod so far:\n[list]\n[*]The Protector's Handgun and its damaged starting variant, as well as the Protector's Armor set.\n[*]USCM Remnant encounters, or more specifically a couple new microdungeons, a new dungeon, and an NPC ship encounter.\n[*]A mech recharging tool!\n[*]The reintroduction of Impervium, now an ore obtained from meteor microdungeons on lava planets.\n[*]On duty Peacekeepers who'll come in to aid friendly NPCs.\n[*]Many new lore codices found across vanilla villages, dungeons and ship/space encounters.\n[*]And much more!\n[/list]\n\n[h1][url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/1397217904/2914346777812575636/]FAQ[/url][/h1]\n\n[h1][url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2141830986]Companion mods[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2626767755]Addons[/url][/h1]\n\n[h1][url=https://community.playstarbound.com/resources/project-redemption.5377/]Chucklefish Forums Link[/url][/h1]\n\n[h1][url=https://github.com/Armokthespideroverlord/Project-Redemption]Github Link[/url][/h1]\n[list]\n[*][url=https://github.com/Armokthespideroverlord/Project-Redemption/wiki]Wiki[/url]\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Future plans:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Earth refugee ships\n[*]Mission and Boss additions\n[*]Virorbs\n[/list]\nAnd much much more.\n\n[h2][url=https://discord.gg/MBaUNt8]Come join the official discord for my mods![/url][/h2]\n\nKnown Incompatibilities:\n[list]\n[*]Any mods that overwrite the fossilgame.lua or destroyruin.lua files, nothing horrible will happen if another mod overwrites these files, it's just that the Grandmaster fossil brush will become useless and that you won't get any new radiomessages for the ruin mission.\n[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1595801436]Supper's Combat Overhaul[/url]: Breaks the lost and found npc somehow.\n[/list]\n\n[url=https://github.com/Armokthespideroverlord/Project-Redemption/wiki/Credits]Credits List[/url]",
