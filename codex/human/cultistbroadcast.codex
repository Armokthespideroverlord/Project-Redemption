  "I am aware that many among you are disturbed by the news of Earth's destruction.

Don't be.

Earth was beyond salvation. What happened to it was PUNISHMENT for how corrupted it became. It had become INFESTED with aliens, and the humans of Earth WELCOMED it.",
"It was the home of the Terrene Protectorate. An organization treacherous to humanity, protective of these creatures, insistent on treating them as equivalent to humans.

We needed that wiped away. Humanity needed a fresh start.

It's true that the cycles ahead will be challenging, that humanity will struggle to survive. But we WILL survive, and we will emerge STRONGER from it.",
"And humanity's future from this point onward... WILL BE CARVED BY THE OCCASUS."
