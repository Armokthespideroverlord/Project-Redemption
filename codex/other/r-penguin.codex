  "It can take a lot to get a Penguin to discuss their history, often bribery, a drink (or two), and a bit of luck might get them to spill the beans. So it might be wise to consider the following with a pinch of salt, as it could easily all be some nonsense or some cheeky joke.",

"Supposedly, the Penguin race came to be as the result of a rogue science experiment in Earth's antarctic. The details are sparse, but apparently they were uplifted and granted fully sapient intelligence. Eventually these newly uplifted Penguins, longing for freedom, hatched a plan to escape, and managed to get away on a supply smuggling freighter. Given their illegal origins they inadvertently found themselves in the criminal underbelly of the galaxy and the rest, as they say, is history.",

"Of course there's only one way to verify the validity of this story, and that would be a simple DNA test, but so far no one has bothered to run the numbers (likely out of fear of retaliation from one miffed Penguin). There have, however, been rumors of a pair of Bears uplifted in a similar manner lately, but it's hard to say if it's connected to the Penguins in any way."
