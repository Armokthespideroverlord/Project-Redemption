  "Much has been said about of the Floran-Hylotl conflict, especially by the Hylotl, but comparatively little has come from the Floran perspective. This is not wholly surprising given our tendency to not record our history, but it is not true to say that we have forgotten it as a result. After all, instead of writing, our history is passed down through oral tradition rather.",

"Understandably this method has not been free from distortion and embellishment with each retelling over the years. Many recollections of the conflict focus on the glory of the \"great hunt\" and unfortunately present the Hylotl as nothing more than prey, perhaps not surprising given the sadly common misconception among Floran regarding their fleshy brethren as not possessing sentience.",

"This however reveals the truth about why our ancestors invaded the Hylotl homeworld. While some of their scholars are keen to declare the invasion as an act of deliberate malice, it was in truth a mere consequence of our ignorance that led to such a dark chapter in both our histories. Had we known better, perhaps first contact with the Hylotl wouldn't have been bloody.",

"While fortunately the period of expansion that had led such a tragedy to happen has long since passed, I still feel that it is a Greenfinger's duty to ensure that such a thing will never again come to pass. I may only be one Greenfinger, but the least I could do is help ensure the my tribe learns to live in peace with the other species."
