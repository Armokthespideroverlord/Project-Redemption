  "The Agaran are a peculiar species, perhaps one of the only known sapient symbiotic species. They appear to be a melding of fungus and Floran, and despite previous assumptions of being parasitical, seem anything but. They appear to only need their Floran hosts for movement and tool usage, while the host in turn has their aggressive impulses controlled, and thus are able to live in peace with their kin without the need for a Greenfinger.",

"While it appears that becoming an Agaran will strip a Greenfinger of their powers, the Agaran appear to know high quality craftsmanship and are able to build sturdy, if quaint homes for themselves. Indeed the Agaran seem to live simple lives as mushroom farmers and only occasionally need to keep the local Sporgus population in check. Unfortunately none seem to take up writing, and thus it is hard to discern their history, a fact made worse by their garbled language which universal translators can only partially discern.",

"Still, it is not difficult to speculate how the Agaran came to be, it is likely that they are in fact a subspecies of Floran originating from the same homeworld as they did, perhaps the results of years of exposure to an alien on the account of their Floran hosts. There are rumors of the Agaran being able to convert Florans through comparatively rapid means however. More research on this curious species is evidently warranted."
