  "The ^orange;Hylotl Stewardship^white;, sometimes known as \"The Empire of The Three Suns\" or even simply \"The Hylotl Government\" is a parliamentary monarchy based on the Hylotl homeworld. While an expansive \"Star Empire\" like the Miniknog and Avian Stargazers, power is conversely held largely in the parliament while the office of ^orange;Emperor/Empress^white; has been reduced to a ceremonial role.",

"Historically however this wasn't always so, in the past, Emperors/Empresses were once much akin to philosopher kings. In fact early on, the parliament was nothing more than a court of elected advisors, but as time went on the parliament began to assume more and more of the tasks traditionally held by the Emperor/Empress, and thus they became nothing more than a glorified philosopher.", 

"Today the parliament operates similarly to the Terrene Electorate of Earth, comprising of elected stewards who are ceremonially presided over by the Emperor/Empress. Unlike the Electorate however, the parliament focuses both on internal and external policy, but thanks to strong isolationist tendencies are not very well known beyond Stewardship space.",

"There is rumor that the Letheia Corporation holds undue sway over the parliament. But this is likely hearsay.",

"^yellow;The Hylotl Military:^reset;
Despite being a generally pacifist society, the Hylotl Stewardship still has a standing military force, the ^orange;Hylotl Defense Force^reset;. It is comprised of Hylotl Warriors, Mech Pilots, and the Royal Imperial Guard, all standing at the ready to protect the Hylotl people from any threat."
