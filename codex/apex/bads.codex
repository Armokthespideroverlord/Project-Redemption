  "Are you having a case of the BADS (Big Ape Deviancy Syndrome)?

Symptoms include:
* Strong dislike of Big Ape
* Disapproval of Big Ape's policies
* Belief that we should not be led by Big Ape
* Denying that Big Ape exists
* Anything short of unconditional fawning adoration of Big Ape.

If you see someone suffering from these symptoms, report them to the Miniknog immediately!"
